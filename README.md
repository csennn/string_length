# string_length
This is a valid Java program that uses the Scanner class to take input from the user and store it in the input variable. The replaceAll("[\\s+,.]","") method is used to remove all spaces, commas, and periods from the input string. The length() method is then used to find out how many characters are left in the string after removing the unwanted characters. The resulting length is printed out to the console using the println() method.
The program also uses the try-with-resources statement, it ensures that the Scanner object is closed when the try block is finished.
